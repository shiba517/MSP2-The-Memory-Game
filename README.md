# MILESTONE PROJECT 2 - THE MEMORY GAME

## OVERVIEW
A study in 2004 by Vladimir Sloutsky found children performed better than adults at a surprise recognition test that was based on the idea that children are more likely to use an induction like thinking when analysing pictures whilst adults are more likely to use a category like thinking. Another recognition experiment was done on another group of children and adults but the test was not a surprise. The results were that adults performed much better than the children.

The mayor of London did not like how much better the adults performed in the latter test. He has hired me to create a game where children's memory skills will be tested, exercised and improved so that the next time this experiment is performed, his local children will close or even beat the performance gap.
