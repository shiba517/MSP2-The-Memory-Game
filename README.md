# MILESTONE PROJECT 2 - THE MEMORY GAME

![Mock-up of website shown across deifferent platforms](assets/readme-files/images/mock-up.jpg)
[View live website](https://shiba517.github.io/MSP2-The-Memory-Game/)

## OVERVIEW
A study in 2004 by Vladimir Sloutsky found children performed better than adults at a surprise recognition test that was based on the idea that children are more likely to use an induction like thinking when analysing pictures whilst adults are more likely to use a category like thinking. Another recognition experiment was done on another group of children and adults but the test was not a surprise. The results were that adults performed much better than the children.

The mayor of London did not like how much better the adults performed in the latter test. He has hired me to create a game where children's memory skills will be tested, exercised and improved so that the next time this experiment is performed, his local children will close or even beat the performance gap.

## THE 5 PLANES
### Strategy
Purpose of the website?
* The purpose of the website is to challenge young children's memory skills, and to exercise it to become better via a fun game.

Target audience?
* The main audience will be children of primary school age as the game/website is to improve children's memory skill. It should be considered throughout the making of the project that parents should also be listed as a secondary audience target as they have the power for the children to have access to the website/game.

Value to the user?
* The user should enjoy the game so it shouldn’t be too difficult or too easy to the point where they will find it boring. As according to the purpose of the making of the game, the user should have their memory skills improve which the user most likely won’t notice but the secondary target audience, the parents, surely will.

What makes a good experience?
* A vibrant, playful colour scheme will evoke excitement to the user. Physical designs of the game should be easily noticeable and not abstract to help keep the simplicity of the look of the game.

How are we different?
* We will really push the subtly push the child's memory skill through dynamic difficulty levels and challenges to keep the children engaged. This game won’t be one dimensional to the point where a child will quickly get bored as children are prone to.

What we shouldn’t do
* Make the game too difficult or easy
The colours to be too dull or adult oriented. It should be remembered that parents are the secondary user, not the main user
Add too many options/features as this may confuse or/and put off the child from wanting to play

### Scope
Feature
* Difficulty level for all intelligence level
* Be able to save the high score for repeat visits
* Explanation of the rules/how to play
* Find out about the company

Content
* Do not contain long sentences as this can bore children. Keep it short and with action
* Imagery should be fun/cute
* No gender bias use of language or visuals as it is a game to solely test memory

Future alterations/additions
* The ability to change visuals to narrow down target audiences. For example, the options to change visuals that will engage with girls more than boys and visa versa.

### Structure
Interactive design
* Colour theme and visuals (i.e., design and positioning of buttons) must be consistent throughout
* Should be obvious when a something has been clicked especially during the game

Information Architecture
* Linnear narrative because he target audience are children therefore navigation must be simple without unnecessary ‘branches’
Nested List becasue it provides straight forward links to chosen destinations. Should also get to the final game within three clicks

## DEPLOYMENT
### Github pages
The website was deployed onto GitHub via the following steps: 
1. Logging into my GitHub account and creating a new repository 
2. Under the subheading ‘Repository template’, I chose the template given to me by Code Institute from the drop-down menu 
3. I named my repository under the subheading ‘Repository name’ and then clicked on the green button named ‘Create repository’. 
4. Once the repository was created, I was lead to my repository page. From here, I clicked on the ‘Settings’ button near the top of the page 
5. Scroll down to the ‘GitHub Pages’ section and click on the text, ‘Check it out here!’, which will be in blue 
6. Under the subheading ‘Source’, click on its only drop-down menu and select ‘Master’ and then click on the button ‘Save’ 
7. The repository webpage will now have been created and the link will now be shown to you for your use 

### Making A Local Clone
You may want to have access via a copy of the repository on your own device. There are three ways to do this: 
* Method 1
1. Login to your GitHub account and open up the repository you would like to copy 
2. Click on the button with a drop-down menu named ‘Code’ which will be placed next to the green ‘Gitpod’ button 
3. You will then have the option to download it on to your system via the ‘Download ZIP’ option 

* Method 2 
1. Open up your preferred IDE and open up the folder where you would the repository to be copied/cloned 
2. In the terminal, type in ‘git clone’ ; do not press enter or anything else 
3. Now login to your GitHub account and open up the repository you would like to copy 
4. Click on the ‘Code’ button again and copy the text given under the subheading ‘HTTPS’. A button next to this text gives you an easier way of copying the text 
5. Back to your IDE terminal, after the ‘git clone’, press the spacebar button and paste in the link you copied from the repository. Your entry in the terminal should look something like this: ‘gti clone https://github.com/shiba517/MSP2-The-Memory-Game.git’. Then press enter 
6. Your terminal will let you know the repository has been cloned and saved to your preferred destination and will be evident when viewing files and folders from your preferred destination
